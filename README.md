# OxCoachRubyTK

NOTE: This no longer functions as the oxontime website, which we were scraping for data, has changed completely. It would be nice if they offered a clear API, but as far as I can see they don't.

Retrieve live travel data for coaches between Oxford and London. Both Oxford Tube and X90 are supported.

(This version is written in Ruby/TK)

To run, you need TK ( http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html ) and ruby.
